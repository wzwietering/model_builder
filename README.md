# Keras model builder
## Why did you make this software?
Creating machine learning models in Keras is quite easy, but I think it can be easier. Editing layers, adding layers, removing layers, it all requires coding. Coding takes time, and code has to be debugged. That is why I created this tool, were the structure of a machine learning model is merely configuration, a set of variables in a file. It also makes it easier to create machine learning models from other code, and to use libraries different than Keras if wanted.

## But Keras has a model format already
Yes, and you can do more with it than with this tool. The API of this tool is more important than the json format, which is still a reason to create this tool.

## Requirements
* Python >= 3.6
* Keras
